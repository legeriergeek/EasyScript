# EasyScript
EasyScript is a programmation language written in C and is in french and in english (this branch is for the french only)
# How to make it WORK
You have 2 options 
- 1. Download the windows .exe 
for this option you have to go on the release tab, download the .exe and enter this command in the command line: EasyScript0.1.exe yourfile.es
- 2. Compile it yourself
for this option i recommend you to use Linux. so for linux download the .c file and put it on a folder then go to this folder and make this in your cli: sudo apt install clang , gcc main.c then make ./a.out.\ 
and for windows make it with the executable please,  compile it yourself in windows is literaly a mess.
